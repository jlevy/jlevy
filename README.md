Hi! My work and interests lie at the intersection of AI, engineering, writing, and knowledge tools.

I believe the purpose of technology is to improve our collective intelligence and to solve human problems. A bit more about me:

- **Tech:** Have build conversational AI systems since early days at SRI with the original Siri team. Built search engines with prominent ex-Google engineers. I have a broad interest in the theory, the practice, and the human element of software engineering, and the history software and AI. Even longer ago, I studied mathematics at Berkeley.
- **Engineering:** Have been a founding engineer and eng leader at several startups in AI, SaaS, and web search (some failed, some successful). 
- **Writing:** Wrote and edited few popular guides (2M+ readers), including [*The Art of Command Line*](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) (which is apparently a top-40 most popular GitHub repo of all time), [equity compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation), and [AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws). Editor and publisher on about a dozen books.
- **Recent work:** I started and run [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/catalog), a platform that has rebuilt the digital book publishing process with dozens of in-depth, web-based guides in entrepreneurship, creativity, and personal growth. We also publish print books. I love to talk to authors, experts, and anyone who cares about sharing high-value knowledge.
- **Inspiration:** The technologist I most admire is [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). His work is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.
- **Random:** I seem to have learned a little about a lot of things. My interests include startups, AI, software engineering, philosophy, good books of all kinds, design, fitness, typography, psychology, fingerstyle guitar, Brazilian Portuguese, kindness, truth, and other arcana.

I'd be glad to hear from you if we share interests. I sometimes fall behind on messages, and more detail or context in a message helps. :)
