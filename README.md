Hi! In case you want to get to know me or my work, this is a cheat sheet.

### Work and Interests

Generally, my interests lie at the intersection of *AI*, *writing*, *software
engineering*, *design*, and *knowledge tools*:

- **Recent work:** *✨new!✨* Lately I’m working on some new ideas for knowledge tools,
  including an AI-native command line, some open source Python libraries for LLM, and
  tools related to uv.
  (See below and do reach out you’re interested or have ideas related to any of these!)

- **Writing and open source:** I’ve edited (and published) about a dozen books and I’ve
  written a few popular guides (2M+ readers), including the [*The Holloway Guide to
  Equity Compensation*](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation) (the most widely
  read guide to equity compensation in startups), [*The Art of Command
  Line*](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) (150K+ stars on GitHub), and
  [a guide to AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws).
  And I’ve written an number of open source libraries in Python.
  Popularity isn’t the best measure of value, but I’m [in the top
  20](https://gitstar-ranking.com/users) most-starred accounts on GitHub.

- **Publishing:** I started and built most of
  [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/catalog), a small startup that has rebuilt the
  digital book publishing process with dozens of in-depth, web-based guides in
  entrepreneurship, creativity, and personal growth.
  We also publish print books.

- **AI and software:** I’ve worked on conversational AI systems since early days with
  the original Siri team at SRI. I’ve built search engines with prominent ex-Google
  engineers. I have a broad interest in the theory, the practice, and the human elements
  of software engineering, and the history of software and AI.

- **Startups and entrepreneurship:** I’ve been a founding engineer a few times and a
  founder. I like working with founders and sometimes consult for or advise startups and
  investors.

- **Engineering:** I’ve loved programming since I was a kid.
  I have been a founding engineer and engineering leader at several startups in AI,
  SaaS, and web search, some failed, some successful (backend/distributed sysems, full
  stack web/JS/Node/TypeScript/React, Python, Java, C/C++, and older esoteric things
  like Lisp and Prolog).
  Also devops—AWS has given me the honor of being an “AWS Hero.”

- **Inspiration:** I believe the purpose of technology is to improve our collective
  knowledge and intelligence and to solve human problems.
  The technologist I most admire is
  [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). His work is as
  relevant today as it was 50 years ago.
  By sharing a vision of what was possible, he shaped how we use software for decades.
  I feel privileged to have met him a few times.

### Personal

- **Values:** There is great beauty in understanding the essential complexity of life.
  But the opposite of a great truth is another great truth: what matters is
  simple—truth, helpfulness, and kindness.

- **Miscellaneous:** I aim to know a few things about many topics and many things about
  a few topics. I majored in physics, math, and computer science and my graduate degree
  is from Berkeley. I like to think or talk about good books of all kinds, philosophy,
  psychology, politics and media, startups and entrepreneurship, AI (history and
  future), product design, typography, software engineering, logic and foundations of
  mathematics, mental and physical health (and their interactions), fitness and
  nutrition, running or hiking the mountains and deserts of California, fingerstyle
  guitar, 15th-18th century lute music, early American blues, Brazilian Portuguese,
  truth, kindness, and some other arcana.
