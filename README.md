Hi! My work and interests lie at the intersection of AI, writing, engineering, and knowledge tools. I believe the purpose of technology is to improve our collective intelligence and to solve human problems. A bit more about me:

- Author of a few popular guides, including on [the command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) (a top 50 most popular GitHub repo of all time), [equity compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation), and [AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws), and editor on about a dozen books.
- Started [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/catalog), a web-based platform that has published dozens of in-depth guides in entrepreneurship, creativity, and personal growth. We also publish print books. I love to talk to authors, experts, and anyone who cares about sharing high-value knowledge.
- Founding engineer at several startups in AI, SaaS, and web search. In an earlier era, computer science and AI research at SRI, with the original Siri team. Before that, I studied mathematics at Berkeley. The technologist I most admire is [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart).
- Other interests: Books of many kinds, startups, software engineering, fitness, typography, psychology, Brazilian Portuguese, kindness, truth, and other arcana.
