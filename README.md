Hi! My work and interests lie at the intersection of AI, engineering, writing, and knowledge tools.

I believe the purpose of technology is to improve our collective intelligence and to solve human problems. A bit more about me:

- Author: Wrote and edited few popular guides (2M+ readers), including on [the command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) (which is apparently a top-40 most popular GitHub repo of all time), [equity compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation), and [AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws). Editor and publisher on about a dozen books.
- Entrepreneur: Started [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/catalog), a platform that has rebuilt the digital book publishing process with dozens of in-depth, web-based guides in entrepreneurship, creativity, and personal growth. We also publish print books. I love to talk to authors, experts, and anyone who cares about sharing high-value knowledge.
- Engineer: Have been a founding engineer and eng leader at several startups in AI, SaaS, and web search (some failed, some successful). 
- Tech: Have build conversational AI systems since early days at SRI with the original Siri team. Built search engines with prominent ex-Google engineers. I have a broad interest in the theory, the practice, and the human element of software engineering, and the history software and AI. Even longer ago, I studied mathematics at Berkeley.
- Inspiration: The technologist I most admire is [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). His work is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.
- Random: I seem to have learned a little about a lot of things. My interests include startups, AI, software engineering, philosophy, good books of all kinds, design, fitness, typography, psychology, fingerstyle guitar, Brazilian Portuguese, kindness, truth, and other arcana.
