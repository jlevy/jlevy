Hi! A bit about me:

Generally, my interests lie at the intersection of AI, writing, engineering, design, and knowledge tools:

- **Recent work:** I started and built most of [Holloway](https://www.holloway.com/catalog), a small startup that has rebuilt the digital book publishing process with dozens of in-depth, web-based guides in entrepreneurship, creativity, and personal growth. We also publish print books. I love to talk to authors, experts, and anyone who cares about sharing high-value knowledge.

- **Startups and entrepreneurship:** I've been a founding engineer a few times and a founder. I like working with founders and sometimes advise startups. I wrote the most widely read [guide to equity compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation) in startups.
  
- **Writing:** I've written and edited few popular guides (2M+ readers), including the equity compensation guide, [*The Art of Command Line*](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) and [AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws). I’ve also edited (and published) about a dozen books by other authors.
  
- **Coding:** I've loved programming since I was a kid. I have been a founding engineer and engineering leader at several startups in AI, SaaS, and web search, some failed, some successful (backend/distributed sysems, full stack web/JS/Node/TypeScript/React, Python, Java, C/C++, and older esoteric things like Lisp and Prolog). Also devops—AWS has given me the honor of being an "AWS Hero."
  
- **Tech:** I’ve worked on conversational AI systems since early days with the original Siri team at SRI. I’ve built search engines with prominent ex-Google engineers. I have a broad interest in the theory, the practice, and the human elements of software engineering, and the history of software and AI.

- **Inspiration:** I believe the purpose of technology is to improve our collective knowledge and intelligence and to solve human problems. The technologist I most admire is [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). His work is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. By sharing a vision of what was possible, he shaped how we use software for decades. I feel privileged to have met him a few times.
  
- **Random:** I aspire to know a few things about many topics and many things about a few topics. I majored in physics, math, and computer science and my graduate degree is from Berkeley. My interests include good books of all kinds, philosophy, psychology, politics and media, startups and entrepreneurship, AI (history and future), product design, typography, software engineering, logic and foundations of mathematics, mental and physical health (and their interactions), fitness and nutrition, trail running and wilderness backpacking in the mountains and deserts), fingerstyle guitar, 15th-18th century lute music, early American blues, Brazilian Portuguese, truth, kindness, and some other arcana.
